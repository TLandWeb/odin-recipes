        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a recipe for Tacos. I quite enjoy tacos, be it home made or from Taco Bell. What I 
            might have to look into is a recipe for mexican pizzas. Those are the bomb. It really is 
            a bummer that Taco Bell had to remove them from their menu again due to the crazy demand 
            that they just can't keep up with. It's wild.

            Thats true, it is really wild. Almost as wild as me filling in all this content by hand rather 
            than copy pasting it from somewhere. But I do like using this very clicky low profile keyboard 
            for all my typing. A+ choice in board.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) carton Campbells Mexican Style Tomato Soup</li>
            <li>12 taco shells, warmed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup shredded lettuce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 cup diced tomato</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook the beef in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef 
                is well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. 
                Season with salt and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir the soup in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to 
                low. Cook for 5 minutes or until the soup is reduced, stirring often.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the beef mixture among the taco shells. Top with the lettuce, tomato, 
                and cheese.
            </li>
